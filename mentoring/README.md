## Mentor Guide

The PaddlePaddle ecosystem has a large amount of PPSIGs. and its ecosystem is so large that no one can give all the answers. Contributors rely on documentation, comment on PR / questions, find mentors, and can interact with others at any time to speed up. Whether it's a slack meeting, an update meeting, participants want to discuss technical details, prospects, or how to be a valuable member. Being a mentor can help someone speed up the path to productivity in PaddlePaddle ecosystem.

In the PaddlePaddle ecosystem, there are many ways to be a mentor. Listening and offering help is usually an informal start, but PPSIGs have some influential plans in place. These procedures take into account the time of the trainee's and instructor. 

PPSIG maintainers play two roles - coach and consultant. They are a problem solver, and although they don't have all the answers, they know the best resources to get the guidance. PPSIG contributors are helping to build a culture of continuous improvement, collaboration and feedback.
