# PPSIG charter Guide

All ppsigs must define a charter to define the scope and governance of the ppsig.

- The scope must define the area where the ppsig is responsible for directing and maintaining.
- Governance must outline the responsibilities and roles within the sig.

## Steps to create a ppsig charter

1. Copy [template](/PPSIG_CHARTER_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Read suggestions and requirements so that you have the context of the template
3. Fill in the template of your ppsig
4. Use personal updates that assume roles defined in the template [ppsigs.yaml](/ppsigs/ppsigs.yaml)
5. In [ppsigs.yaml](/ppsigs/ppsigs.yaml) add the subprojects owned by your ppsig
6. Use your charter.md and ppsigs.yaml to communicate in your sig and get feedback as needed.

## PPSIG charter approval process

When introducing or amending the ppsig charter, the following process should be used.

In this process, we will define the roles of the OARP process (owner, approver, reviewer, participant)

- Identify a small number of owners from the sig to drive the change. The most typical is the chairman of PPSIG.
- Make changes with other members (reviewers) of the relevant ppsig. When discussing with the toc, be sure to keep the ppsig in the loop (next step).

##How to use templates

PPSIG should start with [template](/PPSIG_CHARTER_TEMPLATE.md). ppsig can choose to document differences from these default settings in its charter.

## Objectives

The main objective of the charter is to define the scope of PPSIG and how ppsig leaders exercise ownership of these areas by performing their duties. Most of the energy should be devoted to solving these problems.
