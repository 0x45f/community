This document covers all information about the creation and retirement ("lifecycle") of special interests groups or user groups in PaddlePaddle project. General project governance information can be found in [governance.md](/GOVERNANCE.md).

## Creation

- Propose in accordance with the PPSIG charter procedure and approved by the Charter.

### GitHub Related Process

- Add related rows in [ppsigs.yaml](/ppsigs/ppsigs.yaml) and use the auto generator, this will create the readme file and owners for the new directory in PaddlePaddle community.

- You need to have:

  - PPSIG name

### Communication

Each of these has a linked specification source guide, from setup to hosting, as well as each role and role's responsibilities. We all have a responsibility to implement our code of conduct.

- Create one mailing list for your members and another for your leaders.

Sometimes it may be necessary to terminate the PPSIG. In the long run, PPSIG can be combined with the existing project if it is appropriate.
