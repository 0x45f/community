# SIG Auto Builder


This folder contains scripts for automatically generating documents about: special interest groups (SIG), working groups (WG), user groups (UG) and PaddlePaddle committee.

when the update occurs, all the accompanying documentations will also get updated.


```
sig-<sig-name>/README.md
wg-<team name>/README.md
ug-<user group name>/README.md
sig-list.md
```

For example, if a contributor updates "sig serving," then the following files will be generated:

```
sig-serving / README.md
sig-list.md
```
