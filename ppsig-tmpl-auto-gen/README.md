# PPSIG Auto Builder


This folder contains scripts for automatically generating documents about: paddlepaddle special interest groups (PPSIG), working groups (WG), user groups (UG) and PaddlePaddle committee.

when the update occurs, all the accompanying documentations will also get updated.


```
ppsig-<ppsig-name>/README.md
ppsig-list.md
```

For example, if a contributor updates "ppsig serving," then the following files will be generated:

```
ppsig-serving / README.md
ppsig-list.md
```
